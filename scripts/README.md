# Scripts

- [`checkTranslations`](./checkTranslations.js) - cli script for ensuring language files contain equivalent keys.
  - note: Welsh has a [different plural structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_numerals) than English which means plural keys cannot be directly mapped 1:1. Instead a comparison needs to be performed to ensure equivalence of keys in use.
